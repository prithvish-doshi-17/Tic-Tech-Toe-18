Product of the team 'Ode to Code': Let's (L)EARN!!

A website which helps students to learn online and gain various incentives based on their performance.

The IDEA:
Students (generally in the rural areas) are devoid of quality education and lack the motivation to study. This website provides the necessary motivation in addition to the study material in the form of various incentives for performing well in the quizzes. The website is designed keeping in mind the rural conditions, but it can be deployed in urban areas as well. 

The main idea is to fund the incentives of the students using the CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) of various private companies with which a contract is signed. So, this website actually caters to both the parties involved:

1.) The urban students who use this get quality education and are motivated to perform better and better due to the incentives they get, either in the form of vouchers, books, scholarships or even digital cash (as per the deal with a specific company) based on their scores.

2.) The company which is a part of the deal can use it's CSR effectively in the education of under-privileged children. Also, the companies can do branding and increase it's outreach in rural areas. As an example, a supposed tie-up with Paytm can convince rural people to use Paytm, thus increasing it's outreach in rural areas with the branding done on this website.

Thus, this website can help private companies create a social impact by inducing the necessary motivation in rural students and thereby improving the overall education in rural areas.


EXECUTION:
As a basic demo model, we have implemented the app with following functionalities:
1) Links to chapter-wise content for classes 8-12.
2) Chapter-wise pool of questions of 3 difficulty levels, namely, Easy, Moderate and Tough with respectively varying points scored for      each correct answer, for all subjects of all classes. A set of questions is randomly selected from a large pool, thus providing a        variety to every user each time. Though the points are awarded only for the first time, thereby removing duplicacy of a user for some    particular content.
3) The user can also select to answer mixed questions of varying difficulties.
4) Every user's total points, in whose accordance, he/she would be rewarded the incentives.
 
 Further improvements to the model:
 1) Timestamp in submissions to check regularity of students in the form of a streak, and thus awarding those who study regularly.
 2) Timeouts in the questions according to difficulty.
 3) Contact schools in rural areas and explicitly give login credentials to students so as to avoid muliple entries by same student,         teachers using the app just for incentives, etc.
